# MyReads Project

Are you an avid reader and would like to keep track of the books you've read, currently reading and want to read? The MyReads Apps helps you to track of all of this. The app is interactive and easy to use. You can change the status of each book. You can search books you are interested in. The app is complete with the books' cover art along with the authors' name; easily viewed for each book.

The app was developed following the walkthrough with Doug Brown @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcL7-7cRpkQ&feature=youtu.be
## Instructions to Install and Launch the Project

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
	- Clone the project - I used the Workspace option
    - Open a new terminal.     
    - Navigate to the project's folder/directory
    - Enter 'npm install' at the command prompt - npm dependencies are now being installed
    - Now let's start to the server
    
* start the development server with `npm start`
	- start the server by typing in npm start at the command prompt.
    - You would notice a message that the server is starting. Eventually, the server will display a message:
    	"The app is running at:
			  http://localhost:3000/"
    - Once "the app is at:" message is received, navigate to the address:  http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
